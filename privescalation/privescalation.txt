 Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.

The vulnerability in the insecure.js code lies in its lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
It relies solely on checking the user's role without verifying their identity or session state, making it susceptible to privilege escalation
attacks. An attacker could potentially send a request with an arbitrary userId and newRole, bypassing the authentication and authorization 
checks, and escalate their privileges to that of an admin.

The secure.js version addresses this vulnerability by implementing session-based authentication. 
It uses the express-session middleware to manage user sessions, ensuring that users are authenticated before allowing access to 
sensitive operations like updating user roles. Additionally, it verifies the user's role based on their session data, mitigating the risk 
of unauthorized privilege escalation by requiring both authentication and proper authorization.
 
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Implementing HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.
Implementing input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Implementing rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks and protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
Regularly updating dependencies and libraries to patch known vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture.
Logging and monitoring user activities to detect and respond to suspicious behavior or potential security breaches promptly.
Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security beyond just username and password.
