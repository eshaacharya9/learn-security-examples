 Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.

The vulnerability in the insecure.js code lies in its lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
It relies solely on checking the user's role without verifying their identity or session state, making it susceptible to privilege escalation
attacks. An attacker could potentially send a request with an arbitrary userId and newRole, bypassing the authentication and authorization 
checks, and escalate their privileges to that of an admin.

The secure.js version addresses this vulnerability by implementing session-based authentication. 
It uses the express-session middleware to manage user sessions, ensuring that users are authenticated before allowing access to 
sensitive operations like updating user roles. Additionally, it verifies the user's role based on their session data, mitigating the risk 
of unauthorized privilege escalation by requiring both authentication and proper authorization.
 
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

1. Implementation Weaknesses: These refer to vulnerabilities and flaws in the way security measures are implemented
within the system, making it susceptible to various attacks.

2. Absence of Authorization: Authorization is the process of determining whether a user or system is allowed to perform a 
particular action or access a specific resource. Without proper authorization mechanisms in place, users may gain unauthorized access 
to sensitive data or perform actions beyond their privileges. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or other security
incidents.

3. Exposing Services Which Donâ€™t Need To Be: Exposing unnecessary services or endpoints increases the attack surface of the application,
providing more opportunities for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. It's essential to minimize the exposure of services to only those
that are required for the application's functionality. By reducing the number of exposed services, organizations can reduce the likelihood
of attackers finding and exploiting weaknesses in the system. This principle aligns with the security concept of "least privilege," 
where only necessary access rights are granted to users or systems.
