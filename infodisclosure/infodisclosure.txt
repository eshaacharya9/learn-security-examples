Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability in the insecure.js code lies in its lack of input validation and sanitation. Specifically, it doesn't check
the format of the username input, leaving it susceptible to various attacks, including NoSQL injection. Without proper validation
and sanitation, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the database queries and potentially gain unauthorized access
to sensitive information.

The secure.js version addresses this vulnerability by incorporating input validation and sanitation mechanisms. It checks if the username 
is a string and then sanitizes it by removing any non-alphanumeric characters before querying the database. This prevents NoSQL injection 
attacks by ensuring that the input is properly formatted and doesn't contain any malicious characters that could alter the query's behavior.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?

Tampering violates the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) property of Integrity. By tampering with data or code, an attacker can
 modify or manipulate it, compromising its integrity. In the context of the given scenario, if an attacker successfully tampers with the
  username input or database queries, they could compromise the integrity of the system by accessing or altering sensitive user information.

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
Additional measures could be implemented, such as implementing rate limiting to prevent 
brute force attacks, enforcing strong password policies, using encryption for sensitive data storage, 
implementing authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authorization, and regularly updating dependencies
to patch known vulnerabilities. Additionally, logging and monitoring systems could be put in place to detect and respond to any suspicious 
activities or security breaches promptly.
