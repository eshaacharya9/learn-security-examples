- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Vulnerability Explanation: The vulnerability lies in insecure.js where it lacks error handling for database operations. 
This leaves it susceptible to a Slowloris-style DoS attack, where an attacker can send requests with invalid IDs, causing 
the server to hang indefinitely. secure.js prevents this vulnerability by including error handling, ensuring that even if the
database operation fails or takes a long time, the server will respond with an error message instead of hanging.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Additional Security Mechanisms:

1. Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a specified time frame, 
preventing attackers from overwhelming the server with a flood of requests.

2. Input Validation: Validate user inputs rigorously to ensure they adhere to expected formats and criteria, minimizing 
the risk of unexpected behavior or malicious inputs causing disruptions.

3. Timeouts: Set timeouts for database operations and other critical tasks to prevent indefinite hanging. 

If an operation exceeds the specified time limit, terminate it and respond with an appropriate error message.

4. Monitoring and Alerting: Implement monitoring systems to detect unusual patterns or spikes in traffic that may 
indicate a DoS attack. Configure alerts to notify administrators promptly so they can take action to mitigate the attack.

5. Load Balancing and Redundancy: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers using load balancers and ensure redundancy 
in critical components to minimize the impact of a DoS attack on any single server or service.
