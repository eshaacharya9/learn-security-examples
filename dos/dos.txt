- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Vulnerability Explanation: The vulnerability lies in insecure.js where it lacks error handling for database operations. 
This leaves it susceptible to a Slowloris-style DoS attack, where an attacker can send requests with invalid IDs, causing 
the server to hang indefinitely. secure.js prevents this vulnerability by including error handling, ensuring that even if the
database operation fails or takes a long time, the server will respond with an error message instead of hanging.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

1. Unnecessary Exposure of Services: Reduce the attack surface by limiting the exposure of services and endpoints to only
what is necessary. Disable or restrict access to any services or endpoints that are not essential for the application's functionality, 
reducing the potential entry points for attackers.

2. Lack of Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to mitigate the risk of abuse or exploitation by limiting the number of requests 
a user or IP address can make within a specific time period. This prevents attackers from overwhelming the system with a large volume 
of requests, helping to maintain availability and performance.

3. Failure to Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to Handle High Traffic Loads: Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute
content and handle high traffic loads efficiently. CDNs cache content closer to users, reducing server load and improving response times. 
By leveraging a CDN, the application can better withstand distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and ensure reliable delivery of 
content to users worldwide.
