Q. Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of user input in the registration process (/register route). 
In the insecure code, the user input (req.body.name) is directly stored in the session without proper sanitization,
potentially leaving it vulnerable to XSS attacks. The secure version addresses this vulnerability by implementing input
sanitization through the escapeHTML function, which escapes special characters in the user input to prevent XSS attacks. 
This ensures that the user input is treated as plain text and not interpreted as HTML, mitigating the risk of XSS vulnerabilities.


Q. Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Tampering violates the integrity aspect of the CIA triad. It compromises the trustworthiness and reliability of data by 
unauthorized modification or alteration, leading to potential misinformation or unauthorized access.
